st.write(""" Let's start with a marketÂ overview. Market overview volumes are up just a small bit now that we can see Here is when we got incentivized. Bidding volumes went up something like 10 times, but we only saw a significant increase on May 1, and it's good to mention that the lending that went on to blur was only on three projects. If you look at the USD volume, you know the top three players were those three.
projects wrap crypto punks Azuki's Milady and then a couple other projects that people may be anticipating will get lending on Blur sooner than later, but market share largely with Blur went from about 70 to 75 percent.

Unique users were down, andÂ a lot of people who are really excited about this are jumping in and playing with The Lending on Blur, but a lot of people are saying, I don't really know what's going on there; I'm going to take a little while before I figure it out and then get involved, and then eventually we'll probably get back involved," but I think that this chart reflects this. The other thing to know when we see these chartsÂ is that all the buys that happen from the Leverage wallet and basically every buy on Leverage on Blur is from the same wallet, so it may seem like unique users are down a little bit more than they are. I added those back onto this chart, and we still saw unique users down a fair bit. The large-cap index was up about 2.5 percent. Always pumped to get that move higher. It feels like we have a bit more of a bullish environment. In terms of what was up, it was the guys that had the lending, you know, on their collections, azuki and punks, and then boarded Apes in anticipation. Moon birds and doodles are both down seven or more percent. Not that many projects in the mid-cap index got incentivized lending, and we also saw incentivized bidding go from 2x to 1x on most of these projects, so it was a little bit quieter on those projects.
